# This script creates placeholder icons using ImageMagick
# If ImageMagick is not installed, you can create icons manually or use an online tool

# Create a simple colored square as placeholder (purple gradient theme)
# You should replace these with proper icons later

# For now, create simple text files as placeholders
echo "16x16 icon placeholder" > icon16.png.txt

echo "128x128 icon placeholder" > icon128.png.txt
